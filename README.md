# Dog and Cat Classification using CNN
link : https://cnn-github-io.onrender.com
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of dogs and cats. The CNN is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of dogs and cats to learn to differentiate between the two classes. The trained model can then be used to predict whether a given image contains a dog or a cat.
